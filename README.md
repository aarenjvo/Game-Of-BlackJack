# ACTIVITY: "Game of BlackJack"

I will be creating a simple game of blackjack, where the player starts with $500, is playing against the dealer, and can continue to play indefinitely unless player total bet amount reaches $0.

## INSPIRATION:

I am creating this game because growing up, my dad was a blackjack dealer so playing blackjack with my family was a fun activity for us. Therefore I am super familiar with this game and am going to enjoy making it as my first game project!

## RULES:

-Player total bet amount starts at $500.
-Player bets in amounts of at least $100, and in increments of $100.
-Player clicks button to draw cards until satisfied with combined cards value.
-Dealer will continue to draw as long as combined cards value is under 16.
-If Player/Dealer combined cards value is === 21, Player automatically wins!
-If Player/Dealer combined cards value is > 21, Player automatically loses...
-If Player is satisfied with their combined cards value and that value is lower than the Dealer's combined cards value, without either hands being > 21, then Player loses.
-Player continues to play as long as total bet amount is not = $0.
